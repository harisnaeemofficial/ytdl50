Hey Everyone!

Version 5.0.7:

You can now download playlists from both types of urls!

You no longer have to be in "playlist view" on youtube.  You can copy the url from the address
bar while viewing a video in the playlist

SOURCE CODE IS NOW AVAILABLE FOR VIEWING:

Version 5.0.6:

Good God, I am sorry guys.  Found another bug :(

Bug fix: Downloads were fixed, but ID3 tags weren't being added.

Should be fixed now!

--------------


Version 5.0.5:

Bug fix: all downloads were showing as Unresolved Destination.  
Should be fixed now.

Sorry guys, please forgive me!

--------------


Version 5.0.4:

This update is mainly a bugfix.  There have been users
having issues with a NullPointerException when a download
completes at 100%.  This fix should resolve that issue.

Please let me know if you are still experiencing any problems.

Thanks!
